# decarboxy_database_pipeline
pipeline for creating decarboxylase-transporter database

This pipeline downloads genbank protein sequences of decarboxylase enzymes of Bacteria with potential to accumulate biogenic amines. A database is automatically constructed which contains protein sequences, nucleotide sequences, phylogenetic trees for decarboxylases and colocalized transporters.
