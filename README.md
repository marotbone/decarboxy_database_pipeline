# decarboxy_database_pipeline
pipeline for decarboxylase-transporter database construction

This pipeline downloads genbank protein sequences of decarboxylase enzymes of bacteria with potential to accumulate biogenic amines. It automatically constructs a database which contains protein sequences, nucleotide sequences, phylogenetic trees for decarboxylases and their colocalized transporters for taxons of interest.
